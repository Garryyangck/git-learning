Hi,we are learning Git together.
Have a good time!
This line is written under master branch, means to tell you that the author of this project is Garry!

About this project: 
This is a web page about git learning, but what matters is how I use git to gradually commit ever step of making this. And also I made a lot of git rebase so that I can change the commits' message and even make some of them, whether in a row or not, to be a new entire commit!
